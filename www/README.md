## TODOS

### Must have

- mobile
- Contributing page
- Form submission
  - The Lambda function for automatic submission is almost there...
  - But it's still very prone to bugs, so in the meantime, just render a `<pre>` with the JSON file that people need to add in GH, and direct them to the [corresponding link](https://github.com/kompanion/kommunity-content/new/master/content)
- Header
- **more** (_and more relavant_) **content**
- modal with more recommendations
- Newsletter 
- Room for feedback

### Nice to have

- about page
- user pages
- better space content cards
- Tooltips for skill levels
- Tooltips for the format in the content card
- masonry layout for the content
- filter for the topic when clicking on its tag inside a content card
